# 2D Convex Hull Visualizer

A simple interactive web application to visualize the Convex Hull algorithm using JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. This application implements the Graham Scan algorithm for finding the convex hull.

## Demo

The convex hull of a set of points is the smallest convex polygon that encloses all the points. Think of it as stretching a rubber band around the points - the shape it forms is the convex hull.


## How to Use

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/convex-hull-visualizer.git
cd convex-hull-visualizer
```

2. Open `index.html` in a web browser
    - You can simply double-click the file or use a local server

3. Click anywhere on the canvas to add points
4. Press the `Enter` key to toggle the display of the convex hull
5. Add more points to see how the convex hull changes dynamically
